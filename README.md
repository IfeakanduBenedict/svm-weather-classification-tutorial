# svm-weather-classification-tutorial
This repository contains the complete implementation and tutorial for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) project using a synthetic weather dataset.
The goal is to teach a student how SVMs work, compare Linear vs RBF kernels, and demonstrate their behaviour through intuitive visualisations such as PCA scatter plots and decision boundaries.

The tutorial follows the full machine learning pipeline:

Synthetic weather data generation

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling

PCA for dimensionality reduction

Linear SVM vs RBF SVM modelling

Accuracy evaluation and decision boundary visualisation

All plots included in tutorial.pdf are generated from the Jupyter notebook.
